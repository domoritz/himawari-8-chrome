# Himawari 8 New Tab Page (Chrome and Firefox)

Experience the latest image taken by the [geostationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit) [Himawari 8 satellite](http://himawari8.nict.go.jp/) every time you open a new tab in Chrome or Firefox. The himawari satellite has been deployed by the [Japan Meteorological Agency](http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/indexe.html) and takes photographs of Earth every 10 minutes. Since the new tab page is a simple web page, you can also [try it online](https://domoritz.github.io/himawari-8-chrome).

ðŸ›° **Get the extension from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/himawari-8-new-tab-page/llelgapflianaapmnpncgakfjhfhnojm) or the [Firefox Add-on gallery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/satellite-new-tab-page/)**.

This extension is inspired by https://glittering.blue/, https://github.com/jakiestfu/himawari.js/ and https://github.com/ungoldman/himawari-urls.

## Features of the extension

* Switch between visible light and infrared images from [Himawari 8](http://himawari8.nict.go.jp/), images from the EPIC camera on the [DSCOVR](http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/DSCOVR/) satellite, and [GOES 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES_16) (can only switch in the extension).
* Loads the latest image, updates automatically.
* Automatically loads images at the optimal resolution (incl retina resolutions). If more than one image is needed, automatically downloads tiles.
* Uses Google's caching to take the load from the image servers
* Caches last version in local storage (compressed jpeg) and immediately displays it when you load the page. Then loads the latest image.
* JSON proxy on AppEngine to get around same origin policy. The code is on the [proxy branch](https://github.com/domoritz/himawari-8-chrome/tree/proxy).
* Full offline support
* Images are drawn on a canvas so that we can cache and load it easily.
* The Earth always stay centered, thanks to CSS magic.
* Earth is animated when it moves in

## Develop

Install the latest dependencies with [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/). Then run `yarn watch` in one terminal to compile the bundle in the background. At this point you can choose between two methods to view the page. First, you can run `yarn start` to start the webserver at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/). Note that if you are using this method, you cannot access some browser extension specific features. Second, install the extension as an [unpacked extension into Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) or Firefox and open a new tab. The extension should load in development mode.

To make a release, update the version number in `package.json` and `manifest.*.json`. Then commit the changes and tag it. Lastly, pack the extension (`yarn bundle`), push the code and tags, and deploy on the chrome app store.
